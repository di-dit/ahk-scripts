Where I keep my ahk scripts


I learned how to write code using the notepad text editor that comes stock with windows and wrote using the AHK language.
I'm teaching myself git here now as I expand my knowledge of coding.
Thanks for any advice.

AHK-Scripts\

A repository for common AHK scripts expected to be run globally in the background and operated by a Logitech G-13 Gaming Pad.
Modifications can be made to remap hotkeys to the nunmber-pad (I ran out of keys on the number pad, and keyboard... I wanted my keyboard back, hence the game pad).
